Super Xonotic Brothers aka sxb

Map created by Tyler "-z-" Mulligan <z@xnz.me>

Originally started for Nexuiz, defunkt few a bit after the fork, refreshed with a Xonotic look and feel, then expanded upon ideas.

Mario and Luigi had another brother from another, you.

The map tries to stay true to the original while expanding upon some of the things that make Xonotic and gaming enjoyable.

All images were recreated by myself in GIMP and Inkscape.
